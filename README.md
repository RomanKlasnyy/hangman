# Hangman
A simple game of Hangman, but for programmers. Run the "hangman.py" file to start. Can you recall all the programming languages? You have 8 lives to guess one!

Too hard to play? Run the "hangman-easy.py" to get the same game, but only with popular programming languages as words. Implementations in other programming languages were created with the easy version of the game.
